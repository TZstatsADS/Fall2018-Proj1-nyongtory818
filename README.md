### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Fall 2018

+ Projec title: What makes people happy?
+ This project is conducted by Yixin Zhang(yz3223)

+ Project summary: Here I conduct a brief study of the reasons that make people happy based on the HappyDB. I explore whether people have different happy moments on different reflection period. Then I divide the data into two groups by gender and do a topic modeling to summarize the topic that men and women happy. From the result, we can clearly distinguish the two groups and make a summary.
